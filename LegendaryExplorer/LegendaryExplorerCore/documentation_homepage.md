Welcome to the Legendary Explorer Core API Documentation. This site is generated after every commit to the [Beta branch](https://github.com/ME3Tweaks/LegendaryExplorer) to reflect the current state of the LEC API. Use the Class List or Namespace List sections on the sidebar to browse the functionality of the Legendary Explorer Core library.

If class names or namespaces change, any existing links or bookmarks to this site may become broken. In the future, static versions of this site will be created for each stable release of the library.
